	The Georgia Ports Authority is aggressively pursuing the deepening of the Savannah River to 47 feet to more efficiently serve the growing demands of world trade.  Working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) received the last of all required federal and state regulatory approvals in 2013.  After 14 years of study and review, the project is ready to move to construction.

<h5>The SHEP will improve navigation by:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
		Deepening the inner harbor to 47 feet MLLW and the entrance channel to 49 feet MLLW;
	</li>
	<li>
		Extending the entrance channel by 7 miles;
	</li>
	<li>
		Constructing three bend wideners and two meeting areas; and
	</li>
	<li>
		Enlarging the Kings Island Turning Basin at the Garden City Terminal.
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Current Project Status</h5>
<p>
	At the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 by the U.S. Congress and the signing of the Bill into law by the President, the SHEP can start construction.  The State of Georgia has approved $231 million towards the cost share for the project.  
	How Can You Help?
</p>
<p>
	The project requires $400 million in Federal funding for the project.  Please contact your Congressional delegation and let them know the importance of the SHEP to you and your business.  This project is important nationwide and your support is critical to moving forward.
