That sort of forward thinking by the Georgia Ports Authority has really provided us the opportunity to have that seamless execution. I&rsquo;d probably call it best in class, as it relates to turn times and our drivers being able to come in and out in a pretty rapid manner.&nbsp;<sup><i class="icon-quote-right"></i></sup></blockquote>
