        <strong>Where you do business can be just as important as what you do.</strong> Selection of the best site depends on many factors, including incentives, work force, utilities, and transportation options. With Georgia’s Commercial Corridors tool, finding the best location is now easier than ever. County information, photos, and building and property site specs are regularly updated to ensure you have the right information to make the right decision. (Requires Adobe Flash)
